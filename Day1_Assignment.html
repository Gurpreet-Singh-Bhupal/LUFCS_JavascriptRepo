    <h2> Question 1 : </h2>
    <h5> Explore and explain the various methods in console function. Explain Them. </h5>

    <h5>Note : All Console examples will be seen in console </h5><br>
    <ol>
        <li> console.log()</li>
        <p>Mainly used to log(print) the output to the console. We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean etc. </p>
 
        <script>
            console.warn("Example for Console.log() : ");
            console.log('Gurpreet');
            console.log(5);
            console.log(true);
            console.log(null);
        </script>

        <li>console.error()</li>
        <p>            Used to log error message to the console. Useful in testing of code. By default the error message will be highlighted with red color.</p>

        <script>
            console.warn("Example for Console.error() : ");
            console.error(" This is my generated error message ")
            console.error(null);
            console.error(" Error found !!! ");
        </script>

        <li>console.warn()</li>
        <p>Used to log warning message to the console. By default the warning message will be highlighted with yellow color.</p>

        <script>
            console.warn("Example for Console.warn() : ");
            console.warn(" This is my generated warning ")
            console.warn(null);
            console.warn(54321);
        </script>

<li>console.clear()</li>
<p>
    Used to clear the console. The console will be cleared, in case of Chrome a simple overlayed text will be printed like : ‘Console was cleared’ while in firefox no message is returned.</p>
    <!-- console.clear(); -->
    <p><b>Note :</b>I am not executing this command as all my console will get clear.</p>



<li>console.time() and console.timeEnd()</li>
        <p>
            Whenever we want to know the amount of time spend by a block or a function, we can make use of the time() and timeEnd() methods provided by the javascript console object. They take a label which must be same, and the code inside can be anything( function, object, simple console).
        </p>

        <script>
             console.warn("Example for console.time() and console.timeEnd(): ");
           console.time('Time taken '); 
             let function1 =  function(){ 
                 console.log('function1 is running'); 
             } 
             let function2 = function(){ 
                 console.log('function2 is running..'); 
             } 
             function1(); // calling fun(); 
             function2(); // calling fun2(); 
            console.timeEnd('Time taken '); 
        </script>


<li>console.table()</li>
        <p>

            This method allows us to generate a table inside a console. The input must be an array or an object which will be shown as a table.
        </p>

        <script>
             console.warn("Example for console.table(): ");
            console.table({'Employee Name : ': 'Mark Zuckerberg','Company Name :':'Facebook'})
        </script>


<li>console.count()</li>
        <p> 
            This method is used to count the number that the function hit by this counting method.
        </p>

        <script>
             console.count("First");
             console.count("Second");
             console.count("Third");
        </script>

<li>console.group() and console.groupEnd()
</li>
        <p>         
group() and groupEnd() methods of the console object allows us to group contents in a separate block, which will be indented. Just like the time() and the timeEnd() they also accepts label, again of same value.
        </p>

        <script>
             console.group("Block ");
             console.log(" These are written under a separate block :");
             console.warn(" Warning generated inside block ");
             console.log('Block ends here')
             console.groupEnd("Block ");
        </script>




<li>Custom Console Logs
</li>
        <p>         
            User can add Styling to the console logs in order to make logs Custom . The Syntax for it is to add the css styling as a parameter to the logs which will replace %c in the logs as shown in the example below 
        </p>

    </ol>


    <h2> Question 2 : </h2>
    <h5> Write the difference between var,let and const with code examples. </h5>
    <p>var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope. But while var variables are initialized with undefined , let and const variables are not initialized.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <b> var: </b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
            var is “function scoped”.</li>

            <script>
                console.log(" var example : ");
            function firstBlock() {
                var a=10;
                console.log(a);
              } //block 1
              
              function secondBlock() {
                a++;
                console.log(a);
              } 
              firstBlock();
              // secondBlock(); This is giving error as " Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined at secondBlock "
              //block 2
              console.log("ends here the script")
              /* Since we are using "var a=10", scope of "a" is limited to the function within which it is defined. In this case it is within the global function scope */
            </script>
            

        <li><b> let: </b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
        “let” and “const” are“block scoped”</li>

        <script>
            console.log(" let example : ");
          {
            let l=18;
            console.log(l);
          } //block 1
          
        //  {
        //     l++;
        //     console.log(l);
        //   } ;
        //This is giving error as " Uncaught ReferenceError: l is not defined "
          //block 2
          console.log("ends here the script")
          /* Since we are using "var a=10", scope of "a" is limited to the function within which it is defined. In this case it is within the global function scope */
        </script>

        <li><b> const: </b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned.
        “const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.</li>

        <script>

                console.log(" const example : ")
        {
            const  gravity=9.8;
            console.log(gravity);
            // const gravity=9809;
            //  console.log(gravity);
            //This will give error as " Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'gravity' has already been declared "
        } 
        //    <!-- block 1 -->
           
            // Since we are using "const PI=3.14", scope of "PI" is limited to block 1 and "PI" is not recognized in block 2 

        </script>


    </ul>

    <h2> Question 3 : </h2>
    <h5> Write a brief intro on available datatypes in Javascript </h5>
<ol>
    <li><b>The String Data Type
    </b></li>
    
<p>The string data type is used to represent textual data (i.e. sequences of characters). Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters, as shown below: </p>
<script>
    var a = "Let's Rock"; // single quote inside double quotes
var b = 'He said "Good morning to all " ';  // double quotes inside single quotes


document.writeln(a);
document.writeln(b);

</script>

<br>

<li><b>The Number Data Type
</b></li>
<p>
    The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation e.g. 1.5e-4 (equivalent to 1.5x10-4). </p>

    <script>
        var k=3.1456;
        var c = 4.25e+6;
        document.write(k+" and " + c + " <br>");
        document.write("Some text" / 2 + 10);
    </script>

<br>
<li><b>The Boolean Data Type
</b></li>
<p>The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false), on (true) or off (false), etc. as demonstrated below: </p>
<script>
    var boolVal=true;
    var boolVal2=false;
    document.write(boolVal+" and other is "+boolVal2);
</script>

<li><b>The Undefined Data Type
</b></li>
<p>
    The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.</p>
<script>
    var any;
    document.write(any);
</script>

<li><b>The Null Data Type
</b></li>
<p>
This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.

A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.</p>
<script>
    var nullVal=null;
    document.write(nullVal);
</script>


<li><b>The Object Data Type
</b></li>
<p>
    The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
    
    An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects. You'll learn more about objects in upcoming chapters.
    
    The following example will show you the simplest way to create an object in JavaScript.</p>
<script>
    console.log(" Object Example :")
    var object1={ "studentName":"Abhishek","studentPercentage":98.6,"isGoodStudent":true};
    console.log(object1);
    //document.write(nullVal);
</script>

<li><b>The Array Data Type
</b></li>
<p>
An array is a type of object used for storing multiple values in single variable. Each value (also called an element) in an array has a numeric position, known as its index, and it may contain data of any data type-numbers, strings, booleans, functions, objects, and even other arrays. The array index starts from 0, so that the first array element is arr[0] not arr[1].

The simplest way to create an array is by specifying the array elements as a comma-separated list enclosed by square brackets, as shown in the example below:</p>
<script>
    console.log(" Array Example :")
    var arrayExample=["Abhishek",98.6,true];
    console.log(arrayExample);
    console.log(arrayExample[1]);
    //document.write(nullVal);
</script>



<li><b>
    The typeof Operator
</b></li>
<p>
    The typeof operator can be used to find out what type of data a variable or operand contains. It can be used with or without parentheses (typeof(x) or typeof x).
    
    The typeof operator is particularly useful in the situations when you need to process the values of different types differently, but you need to be very careful, because it may produce unexpected result in some cases, as demonstrated in the following example:</p>
<script>
    console.log(" typeof Example :")
    var arrayExample=["Abhishek",98.6,true];
    console.log(typeof(arrayExample));
    var m=" I am string ";
    var k=984.64;
    var booln=true;
    console.log(typeof(m)+" , "+typeof(k)+" , "+typeof(booln));
    //document.write(nullVal);
</script>



<li><b>The Function Data Type
</b></li>
<p>
    The function is callable object that executes a block of code. Since functions are objects, so it is possible to assign them to variables, as shown in the example below: </p>
<script>
    console.log(" Function Example :")
    var myFunc=function() {
        var work="I am coding";
        return work;
    };
    console.log(typeof(myFunc));
    console.log(myFunc());
    //document.write(nullVal);
</script>
</ol>
